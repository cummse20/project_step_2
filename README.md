# Project Step 2: Research statement

## Preparation

- Reflect again and refine your interest statement.
- Review the concepts and strategies for identifying a research area, problem, aim, and statement ([chapter](https://qtalr.github.io/book/framing-research.html), [slides](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-09.html#/)).
- Continue to comb the literature to gain a better understanding of the research area with the aim to identify a research problem and develop a research statement.

## Objectives

- Build on (and revise) your interest statement refining the scope and gathering and evaluating the literature.
- Identify perceived gaps and potential areas of contribution from your literature research.
- Define a research question or hypothesis.
- Outline the objectives of your research and the expected impact on the field or area.

## Instructions

### Getting started

*Make sure that you have forked and cloned the [`project_web`](https://github.com/lin-380-s24/project_web) repository from GitHub and that your Git and GitHub configuration is set up on your computer. See [recipe](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-4.html#check-your-understanding) and slides [A](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-10.html#/) and [B](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-11.html#/) for guidance.*

1. Open your research project repository in RStudio.
2. Open and modify the `reports/prospectus.qmd` as necessary to complete the steps below.

*Remember to use the edit, add, commit, push workflow to update your GitHub page.*

### Connect with the literature

1. Continue to refine your interest statement and gather and assess the literature with the goal to identify a research problem.
2. First, search and scan the literature focusing on the aims and findings of the studies (this will be found in the abstract sections).
3. Identify at least 4-5 articles that are particularly interesting to you and that are related to your interests.
4. Now look closer at these articles and focus on the following:
   - Skim the article(s) for:
     - the aim(s) of the study(ies) and
     - the main finding(s) of the study(ies)
   - Identify the data and dataset(s) used and how they relate to the research aim(s)
   - Identify the analysis approach and statistical methods used in the research
5. Consider debates, uncertainties, limitations, or contradictions that appear in the literature as you identify a research problem (gap).

### Draft a research statement

1. Develop a research statement that aims to address the research problem (gap) you have identified. Your statement should be a paragraph or two in length and should address the following questions:
   - What is the research problem (gap) you have identified?
   - What is your research question or hypothesis?
   - What are the objectives of your research?
   - What is the expected impact of your research on the field or area?

### Assessing your progress

1. Reflect on the process of identifying a research problem and developing a research statement.

Some questions to consider:

- What did you learn?
- What did you find most/ least challenging?
- What resources did you consult?
- What questions or concerns do you have at this point?
- What do you need to address in order to move forward?

## Submission

1. Use the necessary Quarto features to format your document (*e.g.*, headings, lists, links, citations, *etc.*).
2. Render your project (to HTML).
3. Push your changes to GitHub.
